Process memory layout

each process needs to have information about its memory location (the kernel should store these information)

so things like where the stack begins, very top of the memory block allocated to the process etc

 === High Address ===
- Command line args and environment variables
- Stack Bottom
- Stack Pointer (stack top)
- Free Space
- Heap Top
- Heap Bottom
- BSS Section
- Data Section
- Text Section
 === Low Address ===


Stack will grow down and heap grows upwards
We will have to use memory mappings to have virtual memory and support dynamically growing heap or stack
if free space runs out



Virtual memory
