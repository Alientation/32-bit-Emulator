.advance [?: symbol] [expression], [expression]
    - [?label] [address], [filler]
    - Fills 1 byte with [filler], repeated until current section program counter reaches
      [address]

.fill [?: symbol] [expression], [expression], [expression]
    - [?label] [count], [size], [value]
    - Fills [size] bytes with [value], repeated [count] times

.space [?: symbol] [expression], [expression]
    - [?label] [count], [value]
    - Fills 4 bytes with [value], repeated [count] times

.checkpc [expression] ?[, string]
    - [address], [errMsg]
    - Throws [errMsg], default msg if not defined, if current section program counter is greater than [address]

.align [expression]
    - [value]
    - Aligns the current section program counter to [value]


.bss ?[symbol]
    - [?name]
    - Creates a new bss section of identifier [name], default section if [name] is not defined
    - contain data initialized to 0

.bss* [symbol], [expression]
    - [name], [addresss]
    - Creates a new bss section of identifier [name], with the starting address at [address]

.data ?[symbol]
    - [?name]
    - Creates a new data section of identifier [name], default section if [name] is not defined
    - contain data not initialized to 0

.data* [symbol], [expression]
    - [name], [addresss]
    - Creates a new data section of identifier [name], with the starting address at [address]

.text ?[symbol]
    - [?name]
    - Creates a new text section of identifier [name], default section if [name] is not defined

.text* [symbol], [expression]
    - [name], [addresss]
    - Creates a new text section of identifier [name], with the starting address at [address]


.stop 
    - Stops the assembler from assembling further


EXPRESSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF EXPRESSIONS
	- CONSTANT
		- The expression is made of constant literals that can be evaluated immediately.
	- RELATIVE
		- The expression is made of symbols who's values may or may not be known immediately.

RESOLVING RELATIVE EXPRESSIONS
	- Create a graph such that each node is a symbol and there is a directed edge from node a to
	node b if and only if the expression that defines node a relies on the value of node b
	- If the graph contains a cycle, the expressions cannot be evaluated because of circular 
	dependencies. For example, if (1) depends on (2), (2) depends on (3), but (3) depends on (1),
	there is no possible way to determine the value of the expression


(TYPE)
	- TYPE CASTS the proceeding label symbol

.
	- Current program counter
