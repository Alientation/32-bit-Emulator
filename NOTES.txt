-- STARTUP https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting
[ ] Booting up the computer

-- POWERING ON
[ ] Power sent to Motherboard 
[ ] tells PSU to start powering rest of systems
[ ] Once PSU finishes powering up, tells Motherboard all is good
[ ] Motherboard will start BIOS (Basic Input Output System)

-- BIOS INITIALIZATION
[ ] BIOS starts POST (Power On Self Test) to ensure proper power levels
[ ] POST will load BIOS at the end of memory and puts a jump instruction at
    the first byte in memory (to the end of the memory)
[ ] CPU's processors Instruction Pointer (program counter) is set to 0

-- FIRST INSTRUCTIONS
[ ] CPU begins executing instructions at address 0x0 (first byte in memory)
    but since there is a jump instruction at the first byte, the processor
    jumps to 0xFFFFF0 (or wherever the BIOS was loaded)
[ ] BIOS creates Interrupt Vector Table and provides basic interrupt services
[ ] BIOS runs tests to ensure no hardware problems
[ ] BIOS supplies Setup utility
[ ] BIOS finds OS. Based on boot order that is set up in BIOS Setup,
    BIOS will execute Interrupt 0x19 to find bootable device
[ ] If no bootable device is found, BIOS goes on to the next device listed
    in the boot order. If no more devices are found, then prints error
    "No Operating System found" and stops the systems
