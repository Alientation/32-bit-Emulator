[ ] Work on a tiny c compiler
    [ ] Parse command args
    [x] Small step for man - sample/simple.c
        - simple main function, no args, return 1;
        [x] Lex into tokens
        [x] Parse into AST
        [x] Codegen into basm assembly
    [x] Expressive Expressions
        - '-', '!', '~' and recursive expressions
        [x] Lex
        [x] Parse
        [x] Codegen
    [ ] Functionional Functions
        - calling functions, stack, local variables, register handling, etc
        [ ] Lex
        [ ] Parse
        [ ] Codegen
    [ ] Run in emulator
        - requires basic C runtime that defines the entry point _start and calls the main function
    [ ] Pretty assembly
        - make the output look nice with spacing

[x] Define a standard for using registers
    [x] Parameter registers (x0-x7)
    [x] Return value (x0)
    [x] System calls (x8)
    [x] Caller saved (x0-17)
    [x] Callee saved (x19-x27)
    [x] Frame Register (x28)
    [x] Link Register (x29)
[x] Rework '#' symbol
    - It should not be required to be in front a literal number, in fact
      it should have not be used at all.
[ ] Reorganize cpu instructions
    - Some can alias other instructions.
    - For example, CMP ... can just be an alias for SUB xzr, ...
    - Try to merge some instructions so more aliasing can be done like hlt and nop
[ ] Add new instructions
    [ ] MSR/MRS (Move to/from system register)
        - moves a system register's contents to/from a GPR
    [ ] TLBI
        - Invalidate the TLB, when context switching
    [x] Atomic operations
        [x] LDADD (Load and Add)
            - Value in memory is updated by adding a value
            - Reads in the old value to a GPR
            - LDADD xt, xn, [xm]
        [x] LDCLR (Load and Clear)
            - Specified bits in memory is cleared
            - Reads in old value to a GPR
            - LDCLR xt, xn, [xm]
        [x] LDSET (Load and Set)
            - Specified bits in memory is set
            - Reads in old value to a GPR
            - LDSET xt, xn, [xm]
    [ ] CSET, CINC, CINV, CNEG, CSEL, CSINC, CSINV, CSNEG
        - Conditional set, increment, invert, negate
        - Conditionl select, select increment, select invert, select negate
[ ] Add tests
    [ ] B, BL, BX, BLX, ADRP
    [ ] MSR/MRS
    [ ] TLBI
    [ ] Atomics
        [ ] SWP
        [ ] LDADD
        [ ] LDCLR
        [ ] LDSET
    [ ] NOP
[ ] Refactor disassembler to be in its own container
[ ] Improve preprocessor warning/errors to user
[ ] Improve assembler warning/errors to user
[ ] Add a preprocessor flag that can be added to disable debug prints
    - Or only enable on the debug build
[ ] Allow testing individual subdirectories in cmake target
[ ] Explore reducing compilation time
    - Examine preprocessed output: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Developer-Options.html#index-save-temps
