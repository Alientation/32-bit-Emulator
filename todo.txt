[x] Rework '#' symbol
    - It should not be required to be in front a literal number, in fact
      it should have not be used at all.
[ ] Reorganize cpu instructions
    - Some can alias other instructions.
    - For example, CMP ... can just be an alias for SUB xzr, ...
    - Try to merge some instructions so more aliasing can be done like hlt and nop
    - Add new instructions
        - MSR/MRS (Move to/from system register)
            - moves the pstate register contents to a GPR
        - Atomic operations
            - LDADD (Load and Add)
                - Value in memory is updated by adding a value
                - Reads in the old value to a GPR
                - LDADD xd, [xt], imm
            - LDCLR (Load and Clear)
                - Value in memory is set to 0
                - Reads in old value to a GPR
                - LDCLR xd, [xt]
            - LDSET (Load and Set)
                - Value in memory is set to 1
                - Reads in old value to a GPR
                - LDSET xd, [xt]
