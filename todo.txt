[x] Rework '#' symbol
    - It should not be required to be in front a literal number, in fact
      it should have not be used at all.
[ ] Reorganize cpu instructions
    - Some can alias other instructions.
    - For example, CMP ... can just be an alias for SUB xzr, ...
    - Try to merge some instructions so more aliasing can be done like hlt and nop
[ ] Add new instructions  ***STILL NEED TO INCORPORATE INTO ASSEMBLER AND DISASSEMBLER***
    [ ] MSR/MRS (Move to/from system register)
        - moves a system register's contents to/from a GPR
    [ ] TLBI
        - Invalidate the TLB, when context switching
    [ ] Atomic operations
        [ ] LDADD (Load and Add)
            - Value in memory is updated by adding a value
            - Reads in the old value to a GPR
            - LDADD xt, xn, [xm]
        [ ] LDCLR (Load and Clear)
            - Specified bits in memory is cleared
            - Reads in old value to a GPR
            - LDCLR xt, xn, [xm]
        [ ] LDSET (Load and Set)
            - Specified bits in memory is set
            - Reads in old value to a GPR
            - LDSET xt, xn, [xm]
[ ] Add tests
    [ ] MSR/MRS
    [ ] TLBI
    [ ] Atomics
        [ ] SWP
        [ ] LDADD
        [ ] LDCLR
        [ ] LDSET
    [ ] NOP
[ ] Work on a tiny c compiler
[ ] Refactor Disassembler to be in its own container
