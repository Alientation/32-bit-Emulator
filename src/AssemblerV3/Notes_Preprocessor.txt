PREPROCESSOR STATEMENTS


#include "filename"|<filename>
	- Inserts the file contents into the current file.
	- "filename": looks for files located in the current directory.
	- <filename>: prioritizes files located in the system file directories, if not found, looks in the
				current directory.

#macro [symbol]([arg1 ?: TYPE, arg2 ?: TYPE,..., argn ?: TYPE]) ?: TYPE
	- Defines a macro symbol with n arguments and optionally a return type.
	- If a return type is specified and the macro definition does not return a value an error is thrown.
	- There cannot be a macro definition within this macro definition.
	- Note that the macro symbol is separate from label symbols and will not be pressent after preprocessing.
    - This macro is not the same as the C macro preprocessor in that this is more like a static function

#macret [expression]
	- Stops processing the macro and returns the value of the expression.
	- If the return value TYPE does not match the macro definition TYPE an error is thrown.

#macend
	- Closes a macro definition.
	- If a macro is not closed an error is thrown.

#invoke [symbol]([arg1, arg2,..., argn]) [?symbol]
	- Invokes the macro with the given arguments.
	- If provided an output symbol, the symbol will be associated with the return value of the macro.
	- If the macro does not return a value but an output symbol is provided, an error is thrown.

#define [symbol] [?value] [?\]
	- Associates the symbol with the value, if value is not specified, the default is empty
	- Replaces all instances of symbol with the value
    - Note this symbol will be discarded after preprocessing
    - [\] allows for multiline values given that the character '\' is proceeded by a newline
      will only read the rest of the tokens on this line as the value
    - TODO: perhaps allow parameters to be passed and used, sort of like the C macro

PREPROCESSOR CONDITIONALS
    - Controls which sections of the input files are ignored by the preprocessor.

#ifdef [symbol]
#ifndef [symbol]
#ifequ [symbol] [expression]
#ifnequ [symbol] [expression] --- note these will evaluate the expression
#ifless [symbol] [expression] -- if symbol is less than value
#ifmore [symbol] [expression] -- if symbol is more than value
#else
#elsedef [symbol]
#elsendef [symbol]
#elseequ [symbol] [expression]
#elsenequ [symbol] [expression]
#elseless [symbol] [expression]
#elsemore [symbol] [expression]
#endif
#undef [symbol]
