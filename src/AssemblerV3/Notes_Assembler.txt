DIRECTIVES
----------------------------------------------------------------
.global symbol ?: TYPE
	- Marks the label as a global symbol that is available to any other linked object file through
	.extern directive.

.extern symbol ?: TYPE
	- Marks the label as an external symbol that is declared but not yet defined in the 
	current context.

.equ [symbol] [expression] ?: TYPE
	- Defines a label symbol with the value of the expression.
	- If a previous declaration of the label symbol has a different TYPE than the current definition
	an error is thrown.

.org [expression]
	- Moves the current section program counter to the value of the expression.



EXPRESSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF EXPRESSIONS
	- CONSTANT
		- The expression is made of constant literals that can be evaluated immediately.
	- RELATIVE
		- The expression is made of symbols who's values may or may not be known immediately.

RESOLVING RELATIVE EXPRESSIONS
	- Create a graph such that each node is a symbol and there is a directed edge from node a to
	node b if and only if the expression that defines node a relies on the value of node b
	- If the graph contains a cycle, the expressions cannot be evaluated because of circular 
	dependencies. For example, if (1) depends on (2), (2) depends on (3), but (3) depends on (1),
	there is no possible way to determine the value of the expression


(TYPE)
	- TYPE CASTS the proceeding label symbol

.
	- Current program counter
